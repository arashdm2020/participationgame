    "q1": "What is Participation Game?",
    "a1": "Participation Game is a decentralized lottery platform built on Arbitrum. It uses smart contracts and Chainlink VRF to ensure fair and transparent random selection of winners.",
    "q2": "How do I participate?",
    "a2": "Connect your wallet, ensure you have LUSD tokens, and purchase shares in the current game. Each share costs 1 LUSD. The more shares you buy, the higher your chances of being selected.",
    "q3": "How are winners selected?",
    "a3": "When the token cap is reached, Chainlink VRF is used to randomly select 8 participants. These 8 then go through voting rounds (8→4→2) until a final winner is determined.",
    "q4": "What are the voting rounds?",
    "a4": "After elimination, the remaining 8 participants vote on whether to continue or stop the game. Each round lasts 24 hours. If majority votes to continue, half are eliminated randomly.",
    "q5": "How is the prize distributed?",
    "a5": "90% of total revenue goes to the prize pool. Of this, 85% goes to the final winner and 5% is distributed as consolation prizes to runners-up. 10% is the platform fee.",
    "q6": "Is it safe?",
    "a6": "Yes! The smart contract is built with security best practices including OpenZeppelin contracts, reentrancy guards, and pausable functionality. All transactions are on-chain and verifiable.",
    "q7": "What network does it run on?",
    "a7": "Participation Game runs on Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. This provides fast transactions and low gas fees while maintaining Ethereum security.",
    "q8": "How long does a game last?",
    "a8": "Game duration depends on how quickly the token cap is reached. The target is 7 days. If it takes longer, the cap is reduced for the next game. If faster, the cap is increased.",
